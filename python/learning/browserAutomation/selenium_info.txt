Selenium WebDriver
Selenium Grid
Selenium IDE

We need a webdriver (not Selenium WebDriver). It's a piece of logic that sits between code and the thing
you want to automate.

geckodriver, ChromeDriver, SafariDriver...

Selenium does not maintain these drivers anymore. The webdrivers are maintained by browser makers.
Selenium 2 used to bundle the webdrivers in, but that's not the case with Selenium 3.
