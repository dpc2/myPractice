 - Computer science is the study of problem solving
 
 - Computer science uses abstraction as a tool for
   representing both processes and data

 - Abrstract data types allow programmers to manage
   the complexity of a problem domain by hiding the 
   details of the data.

 - Python is a powerful yet easy-to-use, OOP language.

 - Lists, tuples, and strings are built in Python
   sequential collections.

 - Dictionaries and sets are nonsequential collections
   of data.

 - Classes allow programmers to implement abstract
   data types.

 - You can override standard methods as well as create
   new methods.

 - A class constructor should always invoke the constructor
   of its parent before continuing on with its own data
   and behavior.
